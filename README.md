## ðŸ“Œ Description

This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for the spatial epidemiological analysis of hookworm infection across 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in China from 2016 to 2021. It integrates geostatistical methods and machine learning to identify spatial patterns and major risk factors influencing hookworm prevalence.

## ðŸ“Š Objectives

- Map spatial distribution of hookworm disease at township level.
- Detect geographic and spatiotemporal clustering using spatial autocorrelation and scan statistics.
- Identify key environmental and behavioral determinants using machine learning.
- Provide policy-relevant guidance for targeted hookworm control in endemic areas.
